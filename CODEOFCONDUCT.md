# Code of Conduct

## Purpose
The purpose of this Code of Conduct is to create a respectful, inclusive, and collaborative environment for everyone contributing to the **Robert’s Rules of Order Website Project**.  
Our mission is to help users understand and apply parliamentary procedure through accessible web technology, supported by openness and mutual respect.

## Our Values

## Scope
This Code applies to all project-related spaces, including:
- GitHub repositories and issue trackers

- Work-related social events, development meetings, and course-related collaborations

It also extends to community interactions such as documentation efforts, tutorials, educational materials, and public discussions about the project.

## Expected Behavior
All contributors, maintainers, and users should:
- Be respectful and courteous in communication.

## Reporting Violations
If you experience or witness behavior that violates this Code:
- Contact the project maintainer or designated team lead directly.

All reports will be handled with confidentiality and fairness. Retaliation against individuals submitting complaints will not be tolerated.  
If a conflict of interest arises, an alternative route for reporting will be provided.

- Ban from communication channels or repository access
- Notification of institutional or academic authorities (if applicable)

Enforcement decisions will be proportionate to the severity and impact of the violation.  
Maintainers will follow up at regular intervals to confirm that issues have been resolved and behavior has improved.

## Offsite and Social Events
This Code extends to all project-related events, both virtual and in-person.  
To maintain inclusivity, we will:
- Choose accessible, welcoming meeting spaces.
- Regulate alcohol use and always provide non-alcoholic options.
- Consider parental, dietary, and religious needs in scheduling and catering.
- Make event invitations open and transparent to the whole team.

## Monitoring and Review
This Code of Conduct will be reviewed every six months to ensure relevance and effectiveness.  
Feedback is encouraged through surveys, issue submissions, or pull requests.  
Summary metrics of reports and resolutions (without identifying individuals) may be shared to promote transparency.
